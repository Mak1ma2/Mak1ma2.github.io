Things to do on here <-- creating a planner / to do for the Avlyners 
- The buttons will be classified as "completed", "in progress", and "" (something for when she doesn't start yet) 
- Reminder to self that I will be creating a template on google drawing or on my ipad but it will comprise of multiple pages 
- It will be classified by classes (semesters / years ? will find out soon)
